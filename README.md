## Day 1 - December 23, 2025

**Completed:**
- ✅ Installed Anaconda, VS Code
- ✅ Created GitHub repository
- ✅ Made public commitment on Twitter
- ⏳ MySQL installation pending (will do tomorrow)
- ⏳ Excel practice started (will continue tomorrow)

**Time:** 5 hours

**Tomorrow:** Complete MySQL setup + Excel deep dive

**Feeling:** Good start! Ready for Day 2! 💪



#### Day 2 - December 24, 2025 ❌

**Status:** Difficult day - Learning experience

**Time Invested:** 1-2 hours (Goal: 8-9 hours)

**Completed:**
- ⏳ SSMS installation completed
- ✅ English practice (1 hour)

**Not Completed:**
- ❌ Excel learning (planned 5-6 hours, did 0)
- ❌ Excel projects (0/2)
- ❌ Aptitude (0/20 problems)

**What Happened:**
Morning routine skipped, lost focus early. Struggled with distractions throughout the day. Only managed English practice.

**What I Learned:**
1. Morning routine is NON-NEGOTIABLE
2. Motivation ≠ Discipline
3. Need strict phone boundaries
4. One bad day ≠ failed journey

**Changes for Day 3:**
- Phone away until evening
- Morning routine strictly followed
- Work starts 7:15 AM sharp
- Schedule followed minute-by-minute

**Mood:** 😔 Disappointed but committed to bounce back

**Quote:** _"It's not how many times you fall, but how many times you get back up."_

Tomorrow = Redemption day. 💪
