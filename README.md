**Day 3 of 120 complete. 117 to go. Building consistency daily! 💪🚀**

## Day 1 - December 23, 2025

**Completed:**
- ✅ Installed Anaconda, VS Code
- ✅ Created GitHub repository
- ✅ Made public commitment on Twitter
- ⏳ MySQL installation pending (will do tomorrow)
- ⏳ Excel practice started (will continue tomorrow)

**Time:** 5 hours

**Tomorrow:** Complete MySQL setup + Excel deep dive

**Feeling:** Good start! Ready for Day 2! 💪



#### Day 2 - December 24, 2025 ❌

**Status:** Difficult day - Learning experience

**Time Invested:** 1-2 hours (Goal: 8-9 hours)

**Completed:**
- ⏳ SSMS installation completed
- ✅ English practice (1 hour)

**Not Completed:**
- ❌ Excel learning (planned 5-6 hours, did 0)
- ❌ Excel projects (0/2)
- ❌ Aptitude (0/20 problems)

**What Happened:**
Morning routine skipped, lost focus early. Struggled with distractions throughout the day. Only managed English practice.

**What I Learned:**
1. Morning routine is NON-NEGOTIABLE
2. Motivation ≠ Discipline
3. Need strict phone boundaries
4. One bad day ≠ failed journey

**Changes for Day 3:**
- Phone away until evening
- Morning routine strictly followed
- Work starts 7:15 AM sharp
- Schedule followed minute-by-minute

**Mood:** 😔 Disappointed but committed to bounce back

**Quote:** _"It's not how many times you fall, but how many times you get back up."_

Tomorrow = Redemption day. 💪

#### Day 3 - December 25, 2025 ⚠️

**Status:** Progress but below target - Still learning

**Time Invested:** 4.5 hours (Goal: 8 hours)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Excel basics & intermediate (4 hours)
- ✅ English practice (30 minutes)
- ✅ Morning routine followed

**Not Completed:**
- ❌ Excel projects (0/2)
- ❌ Aptitude practice (0/30 problems)
- ⏳ Only reached 4.5 hours vs 8-hour target

**What Happened:**
Good start in morning (7:30-11 AM). Lost momentum in afternoon. Phone distractions returned. Managed to complete 4 hours Excel + 30 min English but fell short of full day target.

**What I Learned:**
1. I CAN focus for 3-4 hours in morning
2. Afternoon is my weak point - need strategy
3. 8 hours/day too ambitious right now
4. 4.5 hours > 0 hours (progress is progress)
5. Need realistic targets to build consistency

**Changes for Day 4:**
- **Adjusted target: 6 hours** (more realistic)
- Afternoon accountability needed
- Phone away 7:30 AM - 4:00 PM
- Work in 2-hour focused blocks
- Accept 6 hours done > 8 hours planned but 0 done

**What Went Right:**
- Actually studied real content ✅
- Better than Day 2 (1-2 hours → 4.5 hours) ✅
- Morning discipline working ✅

**What Still Needs Work:**
- Sustaining focus full day ⚠️
- Afternoon discipline ⚠️
- Hitting full targets ⚠️

**Mood:** 😐 Not perfect, but building. Small wins matter.

**Quote:** _"Progress is progress, no matter how small. 4.5 hours of focused work beats 0 hours of perfect plans."_

Tomorrow = Continue building. Realistic goals. Steady progress. 💪

#### Day 4 - December 26, 2025 ⚠️

**Hours:** 4-4.5 (Target: 6)  
**Status:** Modified day - Personal commitment

**Morning:** Excel practice (1-1.5 hrs) ✅  
**Outing:** 8 AM - 6 PM  
**Evening:** Excel + Aptitude + English (3 hrs) ✅

**Key Win:** Woke at 5:30 AM (30 min early!) to fit study around commitment.

**Learning:** Life happens. 4 hours > 0 hours. Adapt but don't make excuses.

**Day 5 Plan:** Back to full 6-hour schedule. No interruptions.

**Mood:** 😐 Adapted well, but need consistency.
